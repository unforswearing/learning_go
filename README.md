Teaching myself Go 

1: Rewrite an old Applescript program called [dued](https://github.com/unforswearing/dued)

```
usage:
  ./dued <days> <hours>

examples:
  today = current date

  # print current date
  ./dued

  # add 2 days to today
  ./dued 2 0

  # add 6 hours to today
  ./dued 0 6
  
  # add 5 days and 2 hours to today
  ./dued 5 2 

  # remove 2 days and add 7 hours to today 
  ./dued -2 7

  # remove 3 days and 8 hours from today
  ./dued -3 -8

  # add 4 days and remove 10 hours from today
  ./dued 4 -10

```
